#### approach
used a base 3 number system to represent all possible combinations and patterns of previous array values . 
this is an iterative approach . recurssive approach to generate possible patterns would have performed significantly worse.

#### scope for improvement
One edge case is not been solved for yet due to time constraints. will be solved soon and shared. the cause has been identified and will be fixed .

####
Solved for 5 out 6 formula rows.
