to run 
```
node main.js
```
#### approach
used a base 3 number system to represent all possible combinations and patterns of previous array values . 
this is an iterative approach 
recurssive approach to generate possible patterns would have performed significantly worse.

#### scope for improvement
One edge case is not been solved for yet due to time constraints. will be solved soon and shared.

####
Solved for 5 out 6 formula rows.
